# <Password Generator>

## Description

As an employee, it is crucial to maintain the confidentiality of vital and sensitive information, especially when dealing with competitors. One effective method of storing such information securely is by utilizing complex and random passwords.

As an aspiring web developer, I have worked to build upon a website that generates a randomized passwords based on predefined parameters. To achieve this, I built upon an existing website that had a foundation of HTML structure and CSS, and added logic to the code to make it functional.

I aim to create a responsive, user-friendly platform that allows users to generate complex and randomized passwords. This will assist them in protecting their sensitive information and maintain a higher level of security against potential threats.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Upon visiting the website, users are met with a textarea and "Generate Password" button. Clicking the button generates a series of prompts provided by the browser, allowing individuals to select several arguments. Through these, they can tell the computer how long they want the password, and whether or not they want to include, or exclude certain characters. 

After all prompts have been completed, the password will generate and display in the textarea, so that users may select and copy paste, or write it down.
